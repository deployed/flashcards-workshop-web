Yarn package manager can be installed via `corepack` which is build in Node.js feature.
Run the following commands

```
corepack enable
corepack install
```

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview
```

### Docker

There are two pre build images available for Docker

- `ghcr.io/deployed/flashcards-workshop-web/flashcards-workshop-web:prod`
- `ghcr.io/deployed/flashcards-workshop-web/flashcards-workshop-web:local`

The `local` image assumes API is running under `http://localhost:8000/api` while the `prod` image
uses API hosted on `https://w2025-demo.deployed.space/api`

To run any of these images use following command

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/deployed/flashcards-workshop-web/flashcards-workshop-web:local
```

This will run the image and expose frontend on `http://localhost:8080`

## üì¶ Environment Variables

- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API URL

## üåê Deployment

The application is configured for deployment using GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) with both local and production builds available.
